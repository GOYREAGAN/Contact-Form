# Contact Form

This project is a simple and styled HTML contact form. It allows visitors to easily get in touch by providing their name, email, phone number, date of birth, gender, country, and a message.

## Features

* **Clean and Modern Design:** The form is styled with CSS to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
* **Clear Labels and Placeholders:** Each input field has a descriptive label and placeholder text to guide the user.
* **Required Fields:** First Name, Second Name, Email, and Phone Number fields are marked as required to ensure essential information is collected.
* **Various Input Types:** Utilizes different HTML input types (`text`, `email`, `tel`, `date`, `select`, `textarea`) for appropriate data entry.
* **Dropdown for Gender:** Offers a select dropdown for users to specify their gender.
* **Multiline Text Area:** Provides a larger text area for users to provide more detailed messages.
* **Submit Button:** A clear "SEND" button to submit the form.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5: For structuring the form elements.
* CSS3: For styling the form and making it visually appealing.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the HTML:** Save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file (e.g., `contact.html`).
2.  **Save the CSS:** Save the provided CSS code as a `.css` file named `style.css` in the same directory as your HTML file.
3.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `contact.html` file in your web browser.

You will now see the styled contact form. Users can fill in the details and click the "SEND" button.

**Note:** Currently, the form's `action` attribute is set to an empty string (`action=""`). To actually process the form data (e.g., send it to a server or an email address), you will need to:

* Replace the empty string in the `<form action="">` tag with the URL of your server-side script or email handling service.
* Implement the server-side logic or configure the email service to handle the submitted data.
